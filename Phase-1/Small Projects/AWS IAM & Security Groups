# AWS IAM & Security Groups

## Objective
Set up IAM users and roles, and configure security groups for an EC2 instance.

## Tools Used
- AWS IAM
- AWS EC2

## Steps
1. Created an IAM user: `devops-user1` with `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`.
2. Created an IAM role: `ec2-s3-role` with `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.
3. Configured security group: SSH (port 22, my IP).
4. Generated key pair: `my-new-key`.

## Detailed Walkthrough
### 1. IAM User Creation
- Enabled console and programmatic access.
- Attached `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess` policy.

### 2. IAM Role
- Created for EC2 with `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`.
- Attached to the EC2 instance.

### 3. Security Group
- Inbound rules: SSH (port 22, my IP).

### 4. Key Pair
- Saved as `my-new-key.pem` with `chmod 400`.

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Issue:** SSH connection timed out initially.
  - **Solution:** Fixed by ensuring correct security group rules and key pair.

## Learnings
- IAM users and roles enhance security by limiting access.
- Security groups are critical for controlling instance traffic.
