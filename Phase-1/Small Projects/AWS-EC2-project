# Launch & Connect to an EC2 Instance

## Objective
Launch an AWS EC2 instance, connect via SSH, and set up a basic Nginx web server.

## Tools Used
- AWS Console
- AWS CLI
- SSH
- Nginx

## Steps
1. Created an EC2 instance using AWS Console and CLI.
2. Connected to the instance via SSH.
3. Installed and configured Nginx as a web server.

## Detailed Walkthrough
### 1. Launch via AWS Console
- Selected Amazon Linux 2 AMI and t2.micro instance type.
- Configured security group for SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80).
- Downloaded key pair (`my-key.pem`).

### 2. Launch via AWS CLI
```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <ami-id> --instance-type t2.micro --key-name my-key --security-group-ids <sg-id> --count 1

### 3. SSH connection
```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>

### 4. Web server setup
```bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx

## Challenges & Solutions
- Issue: Unable to view the Apache default page on port 80.
- Remarks: My EC2 instance has port 443 (HTTPS) open, that explains why I was unable to see the Apache default page on port 80 (HTTP).
- Solution: 
    - I inspected the inbound rules of the security group attached to the EC2 instance.
    - Since I was not using HTTPS, I deleted the rule allowing inbound traffic on port 443.
    - And I added a new inbound rule to allow traffic on port 80 from anywhere (using the CIDR range 0.0.0.0/0 for simplicity, though this can be restricted based on security needs).
    - After saving the changes, I refreshed the URL "http://public-ip-address" in browser, and the Apache default page loaded successfully.
